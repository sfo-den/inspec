# Do not add any other code from here until the end of this code
# block.
#
# Before ANYTHING else happens, this must happen:
#
# 1) require minitest/autorun
# 2) alias describe to mt_describe
# 3) require rspec
# 4) disable_monkey_patching from rspec
# 5) alias mt_describe back to describe using change_global_dsl.
#
# Explanation: eventually, our tests get around to inspec/runner_rspec
# (and a few others), and they load rspec. When rspec loads, it
# creates it's own global `describe` method, overwriting minitest's.
# When you tell RSpec to disable_monkey_patching, instead of using
# remove_method, they use undef_method, which blocks access to our
# Kernel.describe. We then need to go back in and reactivate it in
# order for our tests to finish declaring their tests and eventually
# actually running.
#
# Before this, the tests would get to the point of loading rspec, then
# all subsequently loaded spec-style tests would just disappear into
# the aether. Differences in test load order created differences in
# test count and vast differences in test time (which should have been
# a clue that something was up--windows is just NOT THAT FAST).
#
# The OTHER way to fix this is to ban spec style tests in our
# codebase. This is a more rational approach but requires more work. I
# need these tests up and all running and dependable. We can make them
# right later.
