# inspec-test-profile-missing

This is a Chef InSpec profile. It is used in the testing of InSpec itself. This profile was inserted into archives, then the name of the repo was changed, so that it would become unfetchable. This allows us to test the fetchers when they cannot resolve a profile.

This repo is part of the testing material of InSpec itself, and is not intended for public use. No support is provided.
