    h2 Chef Trademark Policy
    p
      small June 16, 2016

    h4
      u INTRODUCTION
    p This document outlines the policy of Chef Software Inc. ("Chef") regarding the use of Chef trademarks and/or logos, including without limitation Chef's Open Source Projects, such as for example, Habitat, InSpec and Server ("Chef Marks"). Any use of any Chef Mark must be in accordance with this policy or a separate license agreement.  Any use that does not comply with this policy or does not have written authorization from Chef is not authorized. Any goodwill generated by the use of any Chef Marks will be for the benefit of Chef.  This Trademark Policy ("Policy") attempts to balance two competing interests: Chef's need to ensure that the Chef Marks remain reliable indicators of quality, source, and security; and Chef's desire to permit community members, contributors, software users and distributors, and others to discuss the Chef products and to accurately describe their affiliation with Chef.  Striking a proper balance is a complex situation that many organizations - in particular those whose products are distributed electronically - wrestle with every day and Chef has attempted to balance it here. Chef protects its Chef Marks on behalf and for the benefit of the entire community. The law obligates trademark owners to police their marks and prevent the use of confusingly similar names by third parties. If you have questions about this Policy, please contact the Chef marketing team at <a href="mailto:marketing@chef.io">marketing@chef.io</a>. 
    p Underlying this Policy is the general law of trademarks. Trademarks exist to help consumers identify, and organizations publicize, the source of products.  Someone's trust in the Chef name and products is crucial to us.  Particularly in connection with intangible products like software, trust is all consumers have to decide on which product to choose.  Chef also caretakes and curates the trust of the Chef community.   This Policy seeks to protect both the public's and the Chef community's trust in the Chef Marks. 
    p In addition, Chef may receive reports about websites or companies using the Chef Marks to promote other products and services, or using modified versions of the Chef Marks. The problem with these activities is that they may be deceptive, harm users, cause consumer confusion, or jeopardize the identity and meaning of the Chef Marks. Such cases range from good intentions but improper use of the trademarks, to people intentionally trading on the Chef brand for their own benefit and/or to distribute modified versions of the product, to a clear intent to deceive, manipulate and steal from users in a highly organized and syndicated fashion. When Chef receives reports of such activities, or identifies problematic activities, Chef analyzes the reports and treats each case individually based on the intent and severity of the matter.  In creating this Policy, Chef seeks to clarify legitimate uses of the Chef Marks.  Although this Policy is composed of a number of specific examples, most reflect the fundamental requirement that<u> your use of the Chef Marks be non-confusing and non-disparaging.</u> "Non-confusing" means people should always know with whom they are dealing and where the software originates.  Websites, software and other services that are not officially maintained or supported by Chef should not imply, either directly or by omission, that they are. These basic requirements can serve as a guide as you work your way through the Policy. 
    p This Policy, prepared by Chef, sets out rules for proper use of the Chef Marks. Some, but not all, Chef Marks include the following:
    ul
      li Chef and Chef Logo
      li Inspec and Inspec Logo
      li Compliance at Velocity
      li CODE CAN
      li RULE THE CLOUD
      li POWERED BY CHEF
    p Chef may update its Chef Marks from time to time and without prior notice. If you ever have any questions about a Chef Mark, please contact Chef at <a href="mailto:marketing@chef.io">marketing@chef.io</a>.  Approved Chef logos can be downloaded here: <a href="http://style.chef.io/branding/">http://style.chef.io/branding/</a>
    p This Policy applies to all uses of the Chef Marks, in text and logo form, whether or not identified above.

      u OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE OF THE CHEF TRADEMARK POLICY
    p The objective of this Policy is to ensure that the Chef Marks remain reliable indicators of source and quality and that they are protected from inappropriate and unauthorized use. This Policy explains when and how you may use the Chef Marks without written authorization and, conversely, when written permission from Chef is required. Chef reserves the right to review all usage of the Chef Marks and to terminate use of the Chef Marks by any party for non-compliance with this Policy or written authorization. Chef may change this Policy at its sole discretion at any time effective immediately upon being published at https://www.chef.io/trademark-policy/ .

      u AUTHORIZED USE OF CHEF MARKS
    ul
      li
        u SUMMARY
        ul
          li AS A GENERAL RULE, THE CHEF MARKS MAY NOT BE USED IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED IN A WRITTEN AGREEMENT SIGNED BY A DULY AUTHORIZED CHEF REPRESENTATIVE OR AS EXPRESSLY PERMITTED BY THIS POLICY. 
          li You must use a Chef Mark in accordance with this Policy. To the extent any part of this Policy conflicts or is inconsistent with any part of a written agreement between you and Chef, the written agreement shall control. No other rights of any kind are granted hereunder by implication or otherwise. <br/>You must obtain written permission from Chef to use the Chef Marks for any use, including but not limited to; (i) merchandising purposes (e.g. T-shirts, mugs); (ii) on or in relation to a software product that includes or is built on top of any Chef product, including Chef's open source projects; or (iii) in an attention-getting or branding manner. Without the express prior written consent of Chef, no Chef Marks may be used in a manner that implies an affiliation with, approval by, endorsement of or sponsorship by Chef.
      li
        u GENERAL GUIDELINES
        ul
          li You may use of the Chef Marks, without a license, provided such use complies with the following requirements: (i) the Chef Mark is used only to refer to the Chef project and/or technology; (ii) the Chef Mark is not used as part of your product, brand, domain, URL, or service name; (iii) the Chef Mark appears less prominent than your company or product name; (iv) the reference to Chef does not create a sense of endorsement, sponsorship, or ownership by Chef; and/or (v) Your use of the Chef Mark is necessary to fully describe your services or products and is limited to as much of the Chef Mark as is necessary for such identification ("Nominative Use").  ALL OTHER USES OF THE CHEF MARK, INCLUDING LOGOS, REQUIRE A WRITTEN LICENSE AGREEMENT.
      li
        u SPECIFIC USE CASES
        ul
          li USE WITH OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE:  We release open source code under the Apache 2.0 license, which permits third parties to copy and redistribute the underlying software under the terms of the license.  However, the Apache 2.0 license does not provide any license or right to use any of the Chef Marks.  You may redistribute the applicable Chef open source software under the terms of the Apache 2.0 license, but You may not use the Chef Marks in doing so without express written permission from Chef or as expressly permitted in this Policy.
          li PUBLICATIONS AND PRESENTATIONS:  Third parties may use the Chef Marks in publications, such as books or magazines, or in connection with the presentations and publications that are displayed to the public (collectively, "Publications"), provided that: (i) such use is referential only: You are simply referring to Chef and its products; (ii) Your name or mark and logo shall appear in a prominent location on the cover or the title page of the Publication and shall be featured with greater prominence than the Chef Mark; (iii) You do not apply to register or register any term comprised or consisting of in whole or in part the Chef Mark, or any confusingly similar mark as trademarks, service marks, corporate names, trade names or domain names, Internet keywords, metatags, or trigger words to lead to a website or other Internet destination; (iv) You do not alter or change any Chef Mark or logo; (v) You comply with this Policy and usage guidelines; (vi) You attribute the Chef Marks with the proper symbol and footnote it on all Publications, webpages, announcements, or anywhere you might use the term.
          li TRADEMARK NOTICE SYMBOL:  When using the Chef Marks, you must use the appropriate trademark symbol (either ™ or ®) as a notice to third parties of our rights to the Chef Mark. A trademark notice symbol must be used in connection with the first and most prominent usage of a mark (e.g. "Chef™"). A Chef Logo must always appear with the TM notice in every use.
          li ATTRIBUTION STATEMENT: You must acknowledge the rights of Chef in the Chef Marks and agree not to register or seek to register any Chef Marks in any country.  All uses of Chef Marks must identify the Marks as being trademarks of Chef with our standard trademark attribution statement. The following statement must be used in all materials using the Chef Marks, including but not limited to websites, publications, splash screens, screenshots or in documentation or source code: "The Chef™ Mark and Chef Logo are either registered trademarks/service marks or trademarks/ service marks of Chef, in the United States and other countries and are used with Chef Software Inc.'s permission. We are not affiliated with, endorsed or sponsored by Chef Software Inc." While you may scale the size to suit your needs, you may not modify any of the Chef logos in any other way (such as by changing the design or color or the relative proportions of the elements which comprise the logo). When using Chef Marks, you will never vary the spelling, hyphenation or spacing of the any portion of the marks. You will never use a Chef Mark as a verb or noun or in possessive or plural form. (This is just good form.)
          li DOMAIN NAMES AND URLs:  You may not use Chef Marks in your own domain names or URLs in a way that would likely to confuse a relevant consumer about the source of software or services provided through your website without written approval from Chef.
          li PRODUCTS AND SERVICES RELATED TO CHEF SOFTWARE:  If you offer products or services related to Chef Marks, you may use the Chef Marks in describing and advertising your product so long as you don't mislead customers into thinking that either your website, service, or product is a Chef website, service, or product, or that Chef has any direct relationship with your organization. For example: "FooCo Management Dashboard for Chef Inspec" is okay.   "FooCo Chef" is not okay, nor is "FooCo Chef Automate Dashboard".  In addition, your website may not copy the look and feel of any Chef website. Again, Chef does not want the visitor to your website to be confused with whom she/he is dealing. When in doubt, err on the side of providing more, rather than less, explanation and information.
          li MARKS AND MERCHANDISE:  You must obtain prior written approval from Chef to use the Chef Marks in any merchandise. In general, permission to use a Chef Mark may be granted for those wishing to create merchandise that promotes Chef and the Chef community. Permission will typically be denied to merchandise that would detract, disparage, or insult Chef or the Chef community. (We hope this comes as no surprise.)
          li MODIFICATIONS:  There is one additional broad category of things you can't do with the Chef Marks - produce modified versions of them. A modified mark also would raise the possibility of consumer confusion, thus violating Chef trademark rights (remember the overarching requirement that any use of a Chef Mark be non-confusing?).
