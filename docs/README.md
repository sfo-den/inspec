## Stability Index

Every available InSpec resource will indicate its stability. As InSpec matures, certain parts are more reliable than others. Brand new features are likely to be redesigned and marked as such.

The stability indices are as follows:

* `Stability: Deprecated` - This features will be removed in future versions, because its known for being problematic. Do not rely on it.
* `Stability: Experimental` - New features may change or are removed in future versions
* `Stability: Stable` - API is well established and proofed. Maintaining compatibility is a high priority
* `Stability: Locked` - Only security and performance fixes are allowed
