# groups

Use the `groups` InSpec audit resource to test multiple groups on the system.

<br>

## Availability

### Installation

This resource is distributed along with InSpec itself. You can use it automatically.

### Version

This resource first became available in v1.0.0 of InSpec.

## Syntax

A `groups` resource block uses `where` to filter entries from the systems groups. If `where` is omitted, all entries are selected.

    describe groups do
      its('names') { should eq ['wheel', 'daemon', 'sys', 'adm'] }
      its('names') { should include 'wheel' }
    end

    describe groups.where { members =~ /root/ } do
      its('names') { should eq ['wheel', 'daemon', 'sys', 'adm'] }
    end

<br>

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this InSpec audit resource.

### Test the group identifier for the wheel group

    describe groups.where { name == 'wheel' } do
      it { should exist }
      its('members') { should include 'root' }
    end

<br>

## Properties
