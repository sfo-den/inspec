## Propery Examples

### report_names

A list of the names of the reports matched by the query.

    describe aws_billing_reports do
      its('report_names') { should include 'myreport' }
    end

### time_units

A list of the time intervals of the reports matched by the query. Valid values: `hourly` or `daily`. This list is de-duplicated, so its count may not match the query count.

    describe aws_billing_reports do
      its('time_units') { should_not include 'hourly' }
    end

### compressions

A list of the compression types of the reports matched by the query. Valid values: `zip`, or `gzip`. This list is de-duplicated, so its count may not match the query count.

    describe aws_billing_reports do
      its('compressions') { should_not include 'zip' }
    end

### s3_buckets

A list of the S3 buckets the reports matched by the query are stored in. This list is de-duplicated, so its count may not match the query count.

    describe aws_billing_reports do
      its('s3_buckets') { should include 'some-s3-bucket'] }
    end

### s3_prefixes

A list of the S3 prefixes (analogous to a directory on a filesystem) that the reports matched by the query are stored in. This list is de-duplicated, so its count may not match the query count.

    describe aws_billing_reports do
      its('s3_prefixes') { should include '/my/path/here' }
    end

### s3_regions

A list of the S3 regions that reports matched by the query are stored in. This list is de-duplicated, so its count may not match the query count.

    describe aws_billing_reports do
      its('s3_regions') { should_not include 'us-west-1' }
    end

## Matchers

Indicates that the query matched at least one report. Use `should_not` to test for Billing Reports that should not exist.

  # Verify that at least one Billing Report exists.
  describe aws_billing_reports
    it { should exist }
  end
