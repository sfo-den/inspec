# azure_generic_resource

Use the `azure_generic_resource` Inspec audit resource to test any valid Azure Resource. This is very useful if you need to test something that we do not yet have a specific Inspec resource for.

## Syntax

```ruby
describe azure_generic_resource(group_name: 'MyResourceGroup', name: 'MyResource') do
  its('property') { should eq 'value' }
end
```

where

* Resource Parameters
  * `MyResourceGroup` is the name of the resource group that contains the Azure Resource to be validated
  * `MyResource` is the name of the resource that needs to be checked
* `property` - This generic resource dynamically creates the properties on the fly based on the type of resource that has been targetted.
* `value` is the expected output from the chosen property

The options that can be passed to the resource are as follows.

| Name        | Description                                                                                                         | Required | Example                           |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| group_name: | Azure Resource Group to be tested                                                                                   | yes      | MyResourceGroup                   |
| name:       | Name of the Azure resource to test                                                                                  | no       | MyVM                              |
| type: | Azure Resource Type to look for | no | Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines |
| apiversion: | API Version to use when interrogating the resource. If not set then the latest version for the resoure type is used | no       | 2017-10-9                         |

These options can also be set using the environment variables:

 - `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME`
 - `AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME`
 - `AZURE_RESOURCE_TYPE`
 - `AZURE_RESOURCE_API_VERSION`

When the options have been set as well as the environment variables, the environment variables take priority.

There are _normally_ three standard tests that can be performed on a resource.

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| name | Name of the resource |
| type | Type of resource |
| location | Location of the resource within Azure |

For example:

```ruby
describe azure_generic_resource(group_name: 'Inspec-Azure', name: 'Linux-Internal-VM') do
  its('location') { should eq 'westeurope' }
end
```

## Properties

The properties that can be tested are entirely dependent on the Azure Resource that is under scrutiny. That means the properties vary. The best way to see what is available please use the [Azure Resources Portal](https://resources.azure.com) to select the resource you are interested in and see what can be tested.

This resource allows you to test _any_ valid Azure Resource. The trade off for this is that the language to check each item is not as natural as it would be for a native Inspec resource.

Please see the integration tests for in depth examples of how this resource can be used.
