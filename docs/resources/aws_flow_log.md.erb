# aws\_flow\_log

Use the `aws_flow_log` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single Flow Log.

## Availability

### Installation

This resource is distributed along with InSpec itself. You can use it automatically.

### Version

This resource first became available in v2.2.10 of InSpec.

## Syntax

    describe aws_flow_log('fl-9c718cf5') do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Resource Parameters
### flow\_log\_id

This resource accepts a single parameter or other search terms. You may pass it as a string, or as the value in a hash:

    describe aws_flow_log('fl-9c718cf5') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe aws_flow_log(flow_log_id: 'fl-8905f8e0') do
      it { should exist }
    end

### subnet\_id

To search for a flow log by the associated subnet id:

    describe aws_flow_log(subnet_id: 'subnet-c6a4319c') do
      it { should exist }
    end

### vpc\_id

To search for a flow log by the associated vpc id:

    describe aws_flow_log(vpc_id: 'vpc-96cabaef') do
      it { should exist }
    end

## Properties
### flow\_log\_id

The `flow_log_id` property tests the name of the flow log.

  describe aws_flow_log(subnet_id: 'subnet-c6a4319c') do
    its('flow_log_id') { should cmp 'fl-9c718cf5' }
  end

### log\_group\_name

The `log_group_name` property tests the name of the associated log group.

  describe aws_flow_log('fl-9c718cf5') do
    its('log_group_name') { should cmp 'test_log_group' }
  end

### resource\_id

The `resource_id` property tests the id of the associated VPC, subnet, or network interface.

  describe aws_flow_log('fl-9c718cf5') do
    its('resource_id') { should cmp 'subnet-c6a4319c' }
  end

### resource\_type

The `resource_type` property tests the type of resource the Flow Log is attached to.
The property will return `eni`, `subnet`, or `vpc`.

  describe aws_flow_log('fl-9c718cf5') do
    its('resource_type') { should cmp 'subnet' }
  end

## Matchers

For a full list of available matchers, please visit our [matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

### exist

Indicates that the Flow Log provided was found.  Use `should_not` to test for Flow Logs that should not exist.

    describe aws_flow_log('should-be-there') do
      it { should exist }
    end

    describe aws_flow_log('should-not-be-there') do
      it { should_not exist }
    end

### be\_attached\_to\_eni

Indicates that the Flow Log is attached to a ENI resource.

    describe aws_flow_log('fl-9c718cf5') do
      it { should be_attached_to_eni }
    end

### be\_attached\_to\_subnet

Indicates that the Flow Log is attached to a subnet resource.

    describe aws_flow_log('fl-9c718cf5') do
      it { should be_attached_to_subnet }
    end

### be\_attached\_to\_vpc

Indicates that the Flow Log is attached to a vpc resource.

    describe aws_flow_log('fl-9c718cf5') do
      it { should be_attached_to_vpc }
    end
