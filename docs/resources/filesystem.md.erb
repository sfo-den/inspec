# filesystem

Use the `filesystem` InSpec resource to audit filesystem disk space usage.

<br>

## Availability

### Installation

This resource is distributed along with InSpec itself. You can use it automatically.

### Version

This resource first became available in v1.51.0 of InSpec.

## Syntax

A `filesystem` resource block declares tests for disk space in a partition:

    describe filesystem('/') do
      its('size') { should be >= 32000 }
      its('free') { should be >= 5000000 }
      its('percent_free') { should be >= 20 }
      its('type') { should cmp 'ext4' }
    end

where

* `filesystem('/')` states that the resource will look at the root (/) partition.
* `size` is the total partition size and is measured in kilobytes (KB).
* `free` is the available space on the partition and is measured in kilobytes (KB).
* `percent_free` is the percentage of available free space, and ranges from 0 to 100.

## Resource Property Examples

The following examples show how to use this InSpec audit resource.

### Test if the root partition is greater than 32000 KB

    describe filesystem('/') do
      its('size') { should be >= 32000 }
    end

<br>

### Test that the root partition has more than 5GB free

    describe filesystem('/') do
      its('free') { should be >= 5000000 }
    end

<br>

### Test if the C:\ partition is NTFS

    describe filesystem('c:\') do
      its('type') { should cmp 'NTFS' }
    end

<br>

### Test if the /var partition has sufficient free space

    describe filesystem('/var') do
      its('percent_free') { should be >= 20 }
    end
