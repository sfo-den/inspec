## Availability

### Installation

This resource is distributed along with InSpec itself. You can use it automatically.

### Version

This resource first became available in v1.51.0 of InSpec.

## Syntax

A `filesystem` resource block declares tests for disk space in a partition:

    describe filesystem('/') do
      its('size') { should be >= 32000 }
    end

where

* `filesystem('/')` states that the resource will look at the root (/) partition.
* `size` is measured in kilobytes (KB).

## Resource Property Examples

The following examples show how to use this InSpec audit resource.
