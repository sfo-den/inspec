title: About the directory Resource
---

# directory

Use the `directory` InSpec audit resource to test if the file type is a directory. This is equivalent to using the `file` resource and the `be_directory` matcher, but provides a simpler and more direct way to test directories. All of the matchers available to `file` may be used with `directory`.

<br>

## Syntax

A `directory` resource block declares the location of the directory to be tested, and then one (or more) matchers:

    describe directory('path') do
      it { should MATCHER 'value' }
    end

<br>

## Matchers

This resource may use any of the matchers available to the `file` resource that may be useful when testing a directory. For a full list of available matchers please visit our [matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).
