# interfaces

Use the `interfaces` Chef InSpec audit resource to test the properties of multiple network interfaces on the system.

## Version

This resource first became available in v??? of InSpec.

## Syntax

An `interfaces` resource block may take no arguments, in which case it will list all interfaces:

    describe interfaces do
      its('names') { should include 'eth0' }
    end

An `interfaces` resource block may take a where clause, filtering on a Filter Criterion:

    # All eth- interfaces
    describe interfaces.where(name: /^eth\d+/)
      its('names') { should include 'eth0' }
    end

Like any InSpec resource, you may also use it for data lookup instead of testing:

    interfaces.where(name: /^eth/).names do |name|
      describe interface(name) do
        it { should have_ipv6_address }
      end
    end

## Filter Criteria

### name

String. The name of an interface.

## Properties

### count

The `count` property returns an Integer describing how many interfaces matched.

  its("count") { should eq 6 }

### names

The `names` property returns an Array of Strings representing the names of the interfaces.

  its("names") { should include "eth0" }

## Matchers

For a full list of available universal matchers, please visit our [matchers page](https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/matchers/).

### exist

The `exist` matcher tests true if at least one interface exists on the system. This is almost always the case.

    it { should exist }
